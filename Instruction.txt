This API allow you to convert your text into vector, no matter how long your text is, 
we have provide to a simple and generalizing approac avoiding 
URL length limits and messy encoding.

Let us suppose the FastAPI is running at 
http://127.0.0.1:8000/
and the endpoint is 
@app.post("/convert-text")
def converter(input_data: TextInput):
........
1- Create a JSON file that contains the text to send to the FastAPI POST API 
for being converted into vector.

example 
Create a file named text.json and put this inside (any long text;
 JSON supports multiline strings too):
{
  "text": "This is the text I want to convert into a vector embedding."
}

2- Call the FastAPI POST endpoint from the terminal 
 Using curl 
curl -X POST "http://127.0.0.1:8000/convert-text" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d @text.json

@text.json means:
"Read the file text.json from the current working directory."

If the JSON file is somewhere else, the full path can be given 

example      -d @"/home/user/myfiles/text.json"
